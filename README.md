# ThreeJs Campfire Scene 
This is a simple three.js scene that I created to learn more about the library. It is a simple animated scene with simple objects portraying a clearing in a forest on a stary night with a campfire in the middle.

This was a single day project meant for learning the basics of three.js and to get a feel for the library. There will be no further development on this project.

## How to run
To run this project you will have to clone the repository and run the npm install command to install the required dependencies. After that you start a vite server. Simply run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
npm install

npx vite
```
